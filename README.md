We planned to begin with authentication features to make sure a user can sign up. Once that is working properly, will make sure a user can view all available players in the Database but they won't be able to add the user to their team through this feature. We will then make a "Open Pack" feature will a user will essentially open a player back of cards, which they can choose 1 to add to their team. After that they will also be able to remove a player from their team.

## Development Process
I was able to go through things as planned, when I realized I had to implement a feature for a user to be able to update a resource. This is when I made the createdplayer resource in the back end and then made the functionality in the front end.

When deleting a created player it needs to be removed from the player database as well.
## Future Features
* Add more information about each Team/Players
* Add more social media share links
* In near future this app gonna be develop to open to public to use and fun.
* The developed app should be upload in ‘appstore’ and ‘GooglePlay’ as game .

## Apps Look a like...
