We planned to begin with authentication features to make sure a user can sign up. Once that is working properly, will make sure a user can view all available players in the Database but they won't be able to add the user to their team through this feature. We will then make a "Open Pack" feature will a user will essentially open a player back of cards, which they can choose 1 to add to their team. After that they will also be able to remove a player from their team.

## Development Process
I was able to go through things as planned, when I realized I had to implement a feature for a user to be able to update a resource. This is when I made the createdplayer resource in the back end and then made the functionality in the front end.

After I had all the buttons and forms, I moved everything to handlebar files to be able to separate my concerns. So I have a landing page, main menu page, my player page, and my team page.

Unsolved Problems
When deleting a created player it needs to be removed from the player database as well.
Future Features
I want to be able to allow the user to have their myTeam face a random team, where through a random number generator based off the difference of the two team ratings, a user will know if their team beat or loss to the random team.
